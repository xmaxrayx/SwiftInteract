# Why? and how? and wtf is this senpai?

we program a script to write our program then the compiler write our program that come from our program again (if you have choosed a noob language like C# `o(><Ôºõ)o` üå∏) ,so its matter of saving time with style, ok this my cringe but good to invest.





why writing 999 same codes when you code a mini-programs.



# Why SwiftIntract ?

- save time for:
  - when learning a language
  - when writing an actual programs
